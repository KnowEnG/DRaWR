\usage{
threeCol2listMat(a = c("a", "b", "c", "c"), b = c("a", "b", "b", "b"),
  v = c(1, 2, 3, 4))
}
\arguments{
\item{a}{(vector): vector of source node names.}

\item{b}{(vector): vector of target node names.}

\item{v}{(vector): vector of edge weights names.}
}
\value{
list of vectors matrix representation.
}
\description{
This function takes a three vectors of equal length (source nodes, target nodes, and edge weights) and return the adjacency matrix as a list of vectors.
